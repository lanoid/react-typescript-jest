# Boilerplate Project

A simple boilerplate project which allows rapid creation of react projects with typescript/jest/enzyme/sass. All compiled using https://parceljs.org/

## Setup

`npm i`

Parcel will attempt to run the project on http://localhost:1234

## Run

`npm run dev`

## Test

`npm test`

### Considerations

SImple folder structure sets you up for success

- src
    - components
    - data
    - helpers
    - style
    - types

This simple set up suits me down to the ground, so I can rapidly develop small projects - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
