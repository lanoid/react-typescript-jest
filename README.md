# Boilerplate Project

A simple boilerplate project which allows rapid creation of react projects with typescript/jest/enzyme/sass.

## Setup

`npm i`

## Run

`npm run dev`

## Test

`npm test`

### Considerations

This simple set up suits me down to the ground, so I can rapidly develop small projects - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
